Gems:
* Canvas - Ruby - Unit - Inheritance
* Canvas - Ruby - Unit - Gems
        Use the colorize gem
        get temperature from user
        color text as follows:
            > 30, .red
            > 20, .yellow
            > 10, .cyan
            < 10, .blue
        convert temperature to Farenheit


Exception handling:
* Introduce an exception handling to print out "cannot divide a number by zero, try again and prompt you to enter two new numbers, if those number could be divided, you print the result and exit the loop"


Gems:
Advanced:
* We are going to create a fun fact generator using the 'faker' gem -> https://github.com/stympy/faker
* First, create a directory called fun_fact_generator, and create a file inside that directory
* Create a loop/method that will greet the user and ask if they want a fun fact
* Use faker to display the fact, then ask the user if they would like another fact
* If they want another fact, give them another one, else exit the app with a farewell message
* Explore the wonderful world of gems -> https://rubygems.org/ <- and select two other gems to make your app super cool!!


Expert:
* Continuing on from our advanced challenge, use importing/exporting to make our code clean and run from the index.rb file
* Can you turn our app into a class?
* Can you make the app dynamic, so the user can choose a fact from different categories in Faker?
